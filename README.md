Working on command line tools in C that make my life more interesting.

## Audio Command Line Tools
- [Discrete Fourier Transform Tool (DFTT)](https://github.com/ymich9963/dftt): Calculate DFT of real-valued data like CSV files/strings and audio files. Also supports FFT algorithms.
- [Swavgen](https://github.com/ymich9963/swavgen): Generate sine, square, saw, and triangle waves in the WAVE file format in a variety of encodings.
- [ADX](https://github.com/ymich9963/adx): Extract data from audio files.
- [Mix2Mono](https://github.com/ymich9963/mix2mono): Mix a multichannel audio file to a single channel.

## Electronics Design Command line Tools
- [TWC](https://github.com/ymich9963/twc): Trace width calculator with IPC2221 and IPC2152 standard support, with multiple methods supprted for IPC2152.
