Working on command line tools in C that make my life more interesting.

## Audio Command Line Tools
- [Discrete Fourier Transform Tool (DFTT)](https://github.com/ymich9963/dftt): Calculate DFT of real-valued data like CSV files/strings and audio files. Also supports FFT algorithms.
- [Swavgen](https://github.com/ymich9963/swavgen): Generate sine, square, saw, and triangle waves in the WAVE file format in a variety of encodings.
- [ADX](https://github.com/ymich9963/adx): Extract data from audio files.
- [WindFcn](https://github.com/ymich9963/windfcn): Apply a window function to audio or CSV file/string input.
- [Mix2Mono](https://github.com/ymich9963/mix2mono): Mix a multichannel audio file to a single channel.

## Electronics Design Command line Tools
- [TWC](https://github.com/ymich9963/twc): Trace width calculator with IPC2221 and IPC2152 standard support, with multiple methods supprted for IPC2152.

## Other
- [WULPSC](https://github.com/ymich9963/WULPSC): Firmware for a WiFi Ultra Low Power Stereo Camera.
- [Theremin MIDI Controller - Phone Based Musical Instrument](https://github.com/ymich9963/TMC-Phone-based-Tactile-Musical-Instrument): A therevin MIDI controller with a companion app.
- [RasPi-PrudensJS](https://github.com/ymich9963/RasPi-PrudensJS): A prototype using a Raspberry Pi 400 with an Explainable AI for a Smart Home Application.
- [PowerShell Adding to PATH](https://github.com/ymich9963/pwsh-add-to-path-env-var): A script I wrote and use to install simple programs by moving them to a directory and adding that directory to the PATH variable.
