Working on CLI tools in C that make my life more interesting. I wield the command line like a conductor’s baton, I unearth data from all sound files, and I am the bridge between code and copper. 

## Audio CLI Tools
- [Discrete Fourier Transform Tool (DFTT)](https://github.com/ymich9963/dftt): Calculate DFT of real-valued data like CSV files/strings and audio files. Also supports FFT algorithms.
- [Swavgen](https://github.com/ymich9963/swavgen): Generate sine, square, saw, and triangle waves in the WAVE file format in a variety of encodings.
- [Audio Data Extractor (ADX)](https://github.com/ymich9963/adx): Extract data from audio files.
- [Mix2Mono](https://github.com/ymich9963/mix2mono): Mix a multichannel audio file to a single channel.
- [WindFcn](https://github.com/ymich9963/windfcn): Apply a window function to audio or CSV file/string input.

## Electronics Design Tools
- [TWC](https://github.com/ymich9963/twc): Trace width calculator with IPC2221 and IPC2152 standard support, with multiple methods supprted for IPC2152.
- [KiABOM](https://github.com/Mage-Control-Systems-Ltd/KiABOM): (Author) A simple and portable KiCad automatic BOM generator script that pulls parts data using KiCost.
- [NCCM](https://github.com/Mage-Control-Systems-Ltd/NCCM): (Author) A KiCad plugin used to generate custom rules for clearances between net classes through a matrix GUI.
